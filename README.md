# ❤️ Heart Disease Diagnostic Analysis – BI & SQL Project  

📅 **Today, I built a new project:** **Heart Disease Diagnostic Analysis Dashboard** 🏥📊  

This project analyzes **heart disease data** to identify **risk factors, patient demographics, diagnosis trends, and key health insights** using:  

✅ **Excel** – Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
✅ **SQL** – Querying & Data Structuring  
✅ **Python** – Automating Data Processing & Visualization  
✅ **Power BI** – Creating an Interactive Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview  

**Heart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide** 🌍💔. This project provides a **data-driven approach to understanding heart disease trends, patient risk factors, and diagnosis patterns** using **advanced analytics and interactive visualizations**.  

With an **interactive Power BI dashboard**, medical professionals, healthcare analysts, and policymakers can **track disease prevalence, identify high-risk groups, and support early diagnosis**.  

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack Used  

🔹 **Microsoft Excel** – Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
🔹 **SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL)** – Querying & Data Aggregation  
🔹 **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn)** – Data Processing & Statistical Analysis  
🔹 **Power BI** – Visualization & Dashboarding  

---

## 🚀 Key Features  

🎯 **Analyzes patient demographics & health conditions**  
🎯 **Identifies high-risk factors (e.g., cholesterol, blood pressure, obesity, diabetes)**  
🎯 **Tracks heart disease cases over time & regions**  
🎯 **Compares patients with and without heart disease**  
🎯 **Provides insights for early disease prevention & treatment strategies**
